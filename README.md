## Stakeholders

### Names

**Sabine Membreno (2nd-year Graduate College Student in NYC)**

My interview was focused on understanding their experiences finding housing and roommates during their graduate studies, as well as current challenges they face with housing arrangements. This allows us as a team to understand the specific needs of a graduate student, such as different schedules, budgets, and living preferences compared to undergraduates. As a result, their six year navigation in the NYC housing market in the midst of academic and work commitments makes them an ideal candidate. It helps us understand the complexity of finding compatible roommates and affordable housing based on our users.

**Dylan Membreno (2nd-year Undergraduate College Student in NYC)**

Throughout the interview process, I involved the discussion around their entry into the NYC housing market recently as a freshman last year. This also includes speaking on their roommate situation and future housing plans. As a sophomore undergraduate student, the team is able to view someone is able to explain what they are looking for with fellow college students in a property with a fresh eye. But in addition, they are able to provide feedback on their current situation roughly a year later into it.

## Goals Or Needs

### To find compatible roommates with similar lifestyles and budgets

Students need to connect with potential roommates who share their living preferences, social activity, study habits, sleeping patterns, noise regulation, cleanliness standards, and financial capabilities.

- **Sabine:** She would like options to find roommates who take their academic/work commitments seriously, avoiding late nights.
- **Dylan:** He recommends roommates who are willing to be clear early on about scheduling and splitting fair groceries fairly.

### To discover available rental properties within student budgets

College students require access to affordable housing, with a location that is either near campus or with good transportation links.

- **Dylan:** I want the ability as a user to avoid getting lost in apartments that clearly do not find my needs in location and price range.

### To coordinate group housing searches and applications

Once students find potential roommate matches on the app, they need tools to organize group viewings, share property listings, and coordinate application processes.

- **Sabine:** It can be a nightmare getting to arrange viewing times with three or more people. I would use an app that gave the ability to do this effectively and efficiently.

### To verify roommate reliability and safety

Students need to ensure potential roommates are trustworthy and legitimate. The app should include basic verification features, reviews, or references from previous living situations to build confidence from users.

- **Dylan:** It would be great to know their own experiences living with other roommates/apartments.

### To manage sharing housing logistics and expenses

Once housing is secured, students need ongoing roommate/landlord communication. In addition they need information on splitting rent, utilities, and other shared expenses.

- **Sabine:** She likes the idea of digitally tracking who owes rent, internet, and groceries.

## Problems or Frustrations

### Current methods of finding roommates feel unsafe or unreliable

Current Platforms (Facebook, Reddit, Craigslist) don't provide adequate screening or compatibility matching due to the nature of these platforms not being tailored for them. They need verification systems in place to expose unsafe or incompatible living situations.

- **Dylan:** Facebook and Craigslist do not feel user friendly when searching for roommates.

### Housing search process feels overwhelming and time consuming

The process of searching multiple websites, contracting different landlords, and coordinating with potential roommates is fragmented and inefficient. Students don't want to waste time managing communications across various platforms. The app needs to prevent the need for synchronizing schedules for viewings and applications, providing a single platform for communication with landlords and roommates.

- **Sabine:** On top of struggling with finding legitimate roommates, you have to juggle emails with several different landlords across different platforms.

### Limited transparency in shared housing costs and responsibilities

Students struggle with unclear expectations about payment arrangements. The app should provide a place where students can avoid conflicts and financial stress when roommates have different understandings of financial obligations.

- **Sabine:** I have heard a ton of stories from friends about payment conflicts, especially since there are times where it has to be upfront.
- **Dylan:** Initial communication is always going to be minimal since you're still getting to know each other. It usually means that things like splitting electricity costs or buying necessities can be complicated.

### Difficulty assessing roommate capability before committing

Traditional methods don't provide users with a reflective view on their potential roommates' living habits, personalities, and lifestyle preferences. Students want to prevent realistic living situations because they weren't able to evaluate their compatibility.

- **Dylan:** You usually get a sense of inauthenticity when conversing through texts. I would like a more thorough foundation of their kind of lifestyle before I waste my time.

### Lack of support for group decision-making in housing decision

Multiple students are trying to choose between different properties, or make group decisions about housing. The app should centralize a method of comparing options, gathering everyone's input, and reaching a consensus. Other platforms aren't streamlined for this and result in delayed decisions and missed opportunities for desired properties.

- **Sabine:** It is naturally a race for some of these apartments. But also you need to be able to discuss the pros and cons with roommates as well.
